# Digit-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)" project. The project aims to build a deep learning model that can accurately recognize hand-drawn digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Project Overview
Digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify and predict the correct digit based on input images.

The key components of the project are as follows:

1. Data Preparation: The data directory contains the MNIST dataset. Perform data preprocessing tasks such as normalization and reshaping to prepare the data for training the CNN model.
2. Model Development: The model directory contains the code for building and training the CNN model. Experiment with different architectures, layers, and hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
3. Model Evaluation: The evaluation directory includes code for evaluating the trained model's accuracy and performance. Assess the model's performance on a test dataset and analyze the results using various metrics.
4. Digit Recognition: The recognition directory contains code for recognizing digits from user-provided images. Implement a user-friendly interface or API that allows users to upload images and obtain real-time predictions.
5. Visualization: The visualization directory provides scripts and notebooks for visualizing the model's predictions and performance. Create visualizations such as confusion matrices, accuracy curves, and sample digit reconstructions.
